# Technojam-Android-Dev-Task-1
My name is AKSHAT KAMBOJ and i am undergrad student of CSE (AIML).I have started learning java recently so this was a very challenging task for me, i have never created an android
app before so this is my first application. i have watched tutotrials of android development from youtube,from there only i'll get the the idea of how things work, which function 
does which work.so this is how i get the basic idea of android developemnt. I have faced many challenges firstly when i installed android studio i have to do many things like 
switching virtulisaton from BIOS and install many more things as i have never done this before this was a bit of challenge for me.second i faced like how to allign constraints 
layout properly and like how to see the id of constarints and other things but i enjoyed it in every bit and i thank tecnhnojam and team to encourage me to choose my future 
domain and to build my first app.
